# Note that this file is consulted when the system is running in single-user
# mode.  At other times this information is handled by one or more of:
# lookupd DirectoryServices  
# By default, lookupd gets information from NetInfo, so this file will 
# not be consulted unless you have changed lookupd's configuration.
# This file is used while in single user mode.
#
# To use this file for normal authentication, you may enable it with
# /Applications/Utilities/Directory Access.
