This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See either the GNU General Public License or the Artistic License for more details.\
You should have received a copy of the Artistic License with this Kit, in the file named "Artistic".  If not, I'll be glad to provide one.  You should also have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.\
For those of you that choose to use the GNU General Public License, my interpretation of the GNU General Public License is that no Perl script falls under the terms of the GPL unless you explicitly put said script under the terms of the GPL yourself.  Furthermore, any object code linked with perl does not automatically fall under the terms of the GPL, provided such object code only adds definitions of subroutines and variables, and does not otherwise impair the resulting interpreter from executing any standard Perl script.  I consider linking in C subroutines in this manner to be the moral equivalent of defining subroutines in the Perl language itself.  You may sell such an object file as proprietary provided that you provide or offer to provide the Perl source, as specified by the GNU General Public License.  (This is merely an alternate way of specifying input to the program.)  You may also sell a binary produced by the dumping of a running Perl script that belongs to you, provided that you provide or offer to provide the Perl source as specified by the GPL.  (The fact that a Perl interpreter and your code are in the same binary file is, in this case, a form of mere aggregation.)  This is my interpretation of the GPL.  If you still have concerns or difficulties understanding my intent, feel free to contact me.  Of course, the Artistic License spells all this out for your protection, so you may prefer to use that.\
